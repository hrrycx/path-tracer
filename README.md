# path-tracer
rust path tracer, mostly from following [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

## to-do
- add ui for easier use, probably will use egui
- tidy code a little
- redo some code to return options, the code is still a little "c++-y" and could benefit more from rusts features
- add new features: mainly textures, obj support, lights, volumes
